# Trivial_Game

# The team has to build a Trivial computer game for 2 players.

# The game is the following:

# The program asks to a player a question
# The program receives the answer by the player
# The program checks the answer:
# If the answer is correct, the player gains 1 point and another question is asked to him
# If the answer is wrong, the player gains 0 point and the program goes to the next player.
# When a player will reach 5 points, he will win the game and the program stops.

# You have access to a file questions.txt: this file contains one question with the corresponding answer for each line.

# The structure of the file is the following:
####
# question1;answer1
# question2;answer2
# question3;answer3
# ecc.
####

# Each time the program asks a random question, but each question cannot be repeated unless all the questions were already asked.

# You can assume:

# if the file questions.txt exists, it has at least one question
# the file respects the given structure
